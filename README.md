## ✨ Why NovaCredit AI?

Banks lose millions to bad loans that could've been flagged early. **NovaCredit AI** turns a trained Random Forest model into a real, usable product — not just a Jupyter notebook. Enter applicant details, get an instant, explainable risk verdict, and track your entire portfolio's health from one beautiful dashboard.

> 💡 Built to prove that a data science pipeline can become a genuinely production-feeling FinTech app — form → prediction → storage → analytics → reporting, all wired together.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎯 Prediction Engine
- Guided **3-step form** (Customer → Financial → Loan Info) with live validation
- Instant prediction via a pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier**
- Animated **risk gauge** + probability-of-default score
- 💡 Explainable, plain-language risk factors & recommendations

### 📊 Analytics & Insights
- 9+ **interactive Chart.js** visualizations: age, income, credit score, loan purpose, city-wise counts, monthly trend, feature importance, risk split
- 👥 Customer statistics dashboard with portfolio-wide aggregates
- 🛡️ Admin control center with live KPIs and recent activity feed

### 🗂️ Data & Reporting
- Full prediction **history** — search 🔍, sort ↕️, filter 🎚️, paginate, delete 🗑️
- 📄 Branded **PDF reports** per prediction (ReportLab) + printable browser view
- ⬇️ Export entire history to **CSV** or **PDF**

### 🎨 Design
- 💎 Glassmorphism FinTech UI — dark navy + purple, gradient accents
- 🌗 **Dark / Light mode** toggle, remembered via `localStorage`
- 📱 Fully responsive — desktop, tablet, mobile

## ⚠️ Important: How Predictions Actually Work

`Model_Training.ipynb` trains the **Random Forest** model directly on **raw, unscaled** feature values — `StandardScaler` in that notebook is only used for the KNN/MLP experiments, never for the Random Forest.

To stay faithful to how the model was actually trained, `models/predictor.py`:
- ✅ Feeds **raw** feature values into `random_forest_model.pkl`
- ❌ Does **not** apply `scaler.pkl` before that prediction

Applying the scaler here would put the model's inputs on a completely different scale than it saw during training and silently corrupt every prediction. `scaler.pkl` is still loaded and available in the codebase for transparency and any future model that needs it.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this retrain the model every time?**
No — it loads the existing `random_forest_model.pkl` and runs inference only.

**Q: Why isn't the scaler applied before prediction?**
Because the Random Forest was trained on raw, unscaled data — see [How the ML Pipeline Works](#-how-the-ml-pipeline-works).

**Q: Can I use my own dataset?**
Yes — retrain using `Model_Training.ipynb` and drop the new `.pkl` files into the project root.
